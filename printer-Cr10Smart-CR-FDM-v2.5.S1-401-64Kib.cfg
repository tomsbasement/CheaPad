# !CR-10 Smart
# printer_size: 300x300x400
# version: 3.5
# This file contains pin mappings for the Creality CR-10 Smart
# with a CR-FDM-v2.5.S1 board.
# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F401
# with a "64KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)
# Flash this firmware on the MCU by copying "out/klipper.bin" to an SD
# card and turning the printer on with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.
# The machine itself includes a small router that can run a Klipper
# frontend. You don't need to buy a single-board computer.
# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
